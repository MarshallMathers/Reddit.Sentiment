# Reddit Sentiment

## My Goal
During my final semester at Wentworth institute of Technology I wanted to explore how natural language processing works and get experience in the tool kits available for Python. Using PRAW I wanted to scrape subreddits that were relevant to cryptocurrency data and use NLTK to run sentiment analysis on last 100 titles of the subreddit to get an idea of the recent sentiment on the topic of the subreddit. To add to this I wanted to make this a rather light weight application so that I could take these scripts and run them on a Raspberry Pi. To help explore how NLTK works I implemented a Niave Bayes Classification algorithm to try and better hone in on specific cryptocurrency related topics.
